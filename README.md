## Project Setup
>Clone our github repository.
>## Getting Started
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

  Follow these steps.
  - First get Flutter and all necessary SDK/Plugins installed. Full guide here [Flutter: Get Started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  - Now create a new Flutter App, named as **'sahara'** with  Compatibility.
    ```
    flutter create sahara
    ```
  - Now download this [Repo](https://github.com/vaishnavirshah/TLE/tree/master)
    ```
    git clone URL
    ```
   
  - Extract the Repo into your newly created **sahara** and replace the required files.
  - Now go to [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and start a new project. Follow these [guidelines](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) here and paste the file **google-services.json** from there into your project. (We are doing this just for Android Platform)
    
    _'yourDirectory'\sahara\android\app_
    
  - Now Populate your FireStore Database like examples below:

    ![Firebase_Example_02](https://github.com/vaishnavirshah/TLE/blob/master/Screenshot%20(121)_LI.jpg)
    ![Firebase_Example_03](https://github.com/vaishnavirshah/TLE/blob/master/Screenshot%20(118)_LI.jpg)
    ![Firebase_Example_04](https://github.com/vaishnavirshah/TLE/blob/master/Screenshot%20(122).png)
   
  - Now you can Finally run VS-Code or Android Studio whichever you prefer and get the flutter packages and just run the App.
  ```
  flutter run
  ```

## Usage
>Ensure that your Android device has Allowed Permissions for third-party app installations. 

## Applications
>Today we see that there are various organisations doing the noble job of supplying food to those who are needy.But these organisations are never sure about how much food they are going to donate and how many people the food is going to suffice. Thus our app can gives them a fair estimate of the quantity of the food and range of people it can serve.This information can also help these organisations to make the necessary adjustments based on the judgment of available food. Moreover, our product will save these guys the trouble to wander in search of potential donors.Not only these big organisations, but individuals(needy) who are capable enough to understand the process can make good use of this.Most importantly,we are indirectly contributing to fulfill the needs of the underpriviledged society.

## Future scope
>We ouserlves feel the need of a automated delivery system.It might happen that the Receivers do not have the required resources to reach out the location and pickup food.
So maybe if we can integrate exisiting companies' APIs,it can be a great milestone.
