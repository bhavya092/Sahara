## Usage
>Ensure that your Android device has Allowed Permissions for third-party app installations. 

## Applications
>Today we see that there are various organisations doing the noble job of supplying food to those who are needy.But these organisations are never sure about how much food they are going to donate and how many people the food is going to suffice. Thus this app can gives them a fair estimate of the quantity of the food and range of people it can serve.This information can also help these organisations to make the necessary adjustments based on the judgment of available food. Moreover, our product will save these guys the trouble to wander in search of potential donors.Not only these big organisations, but individuals(needy) who are capable enough to understand the process can make good use of this.Most importantly,we are indirectly contributing to fulfill the needs of the underpriviledged society.

## Future scope
>We ouserlves feel the need of a automated delivery system.It might happen that the Receivers do not have the required resources to reach out the location and pickup food.
So maybe if we can integrate exisiting companies' APIs,it can be a great milestone.
